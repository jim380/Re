Typically, the cxlRejReason field provides a numerical code or value that represents a specific reason for the order cancellation rejection. Examples of common cxlRejReason values in the FIX protocol include:
  //  0: Too Late to Cancel
  //  1: Unknown Order
  //  2: Broker/Exchange Option

  //  7: Other

  // An integer field that specifies the message sequence number of the order cancellation request to which this message is responding. When an order cancellation request is submitted, it is assigned a unique message sequence number by the FIX engine or the trading system. This sequence number is used to track and identify specific messages within the order flow. The cxlRejResponseTo field in the OrdersCancelReject message is populated with the sequence number of the original order cancellation request message that resulted in the rejection.
